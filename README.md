## Description

This is a place for artists to share their unfinished and in-progress work so that other artists can view and critique throughout the process.

## Installation

git clone

## Usage

In the terminal, log into mysql and type the following:

source db/schema.sql;

use museum_db;

quit

Once out of mysql, type the following:

node seeds/index.js

npm start

The database has now been created and seeded with data to test. 
Using Insomnia, you can perform requests to make sure the database and routes are working correctly.

When you navigate to the deployed page, you can login or signup from the homepage. If you are not logged in, your functionality is limited. Once logged in, you can view your profile and edit its contents. From the profile page, you can also upload images that will be stored in the cloud and rendered to your personal gallery. In the search bar, you can search for images by keyword. If the image title contains that word, it will be displayed on the results page that is rendered. When you click on an image in that or any other gallery, you will be redirected to that image's page where you can view and leave comments on the image. To logout, click Logout in the navigation bar.
